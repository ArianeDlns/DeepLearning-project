# Deep Learning-project
Project for the Deep Learning course @CentraleSup√©lec 

In this competition, your task is to predict engagement with a pet's profile based on the photograph for that profile. You are also provided with hand-labelled metadata for each photo. The dataset for this competition therefore comprises both images and tabular data.

## Installation
Based on the Kaggle challenge :dog: [petfinder-pawpularity-score](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-pawpularity-score/data).   
Data can be downloaded directly on kaggle.
